Catwork does not natively come packaged with a runtime, although `Script` instances can safely access the `Catwork`
module. You'll need some way of starting `ModuleScript` instances if you wish to take full advantage of the motivations
behind `Object`s though.

# Installation

## In Roblox:

Download the latest release and drag it into Studio, or use a tool like [Dropper](https://create.roblox.com/store/asset/13404068475/Dropper-External-file-inserter) to insert it for you.

## In external editors

Catwork's stable releases are published to Wally, and you can add it to your package index using the following string:

```toml
catwork = "metatablecat/catwork@0.0.0" # add the version as neccessary, use the wally index for latest version
```

# Usage

This Object simply greets the player when they join:

```lua
local ReplicatedFirst = game:GetService("ReplicatedFirst")
local Catwork = require(ReplicatedFirst.Catwork)

Catwork.new {
  Init = function(self)
    Players.PlayerAdded:Connect(function(p)
      print(`Hello {p.Name}!`)
    end)
  end
}
```

This only scratches the true function of what Catwork can do, `Service` considerably increases the power of
Catwork! See the documentation for more information.
