# Types

Currently, Catwork does not implement typing. This is because we cant get it to
do what we want to.

Unlike Tabby, where objects were more statically defined, Catwork allows you to
effectively create whatever you want and map some Fragment methods upon it.

The current syntax of Luau typing makes this impossible to type how we want it.

:::tip Feel free to contribute!
If you can somehow get Luau to properly type Catwork, feel free to send in a
pull request.

If Luau releases scripted or constrained generic types, we may be able to make
Luau smarter with this framework.
